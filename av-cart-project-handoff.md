# AV Cart Project - Complete Handoff Documentation

## Project Overview
Design and build a custom mobile AV cart for panel conference applications that consolidates a Tascam Model 12 mixer and Rodecaster Video into a professional, transport-friendly solution using 8020 aluminum extrusion.

## Original Research Summary

### Equipment Requirements
- **Tascam Model 12 Mixer**: 13.5" W × 14.2" D × 3.9" H (approx 15 lbs)
- **Rodecaster Video**: 12" W × 5.2" D × 2.4" H (approx 3 lbs)
- **Monitor**: 15" USB-C travel monitor (lightweight, ~2-3 lbs)
- **COB Lights**: 2× Coolcam CB200C - 11.4" × 8.7" × 3.5" each (4.4 lbs each)
- **Cables**: Standard complement of XLR, 1/4", HDMI cables
- **Total Equipment Weight**: Approximately 42 lbs

### Critical Design Constraints
1. **ADA Elevator Compliance**: Maximum 32" width for 36" door clearance (we're using 36" which still fits)
2. **Ergonomics**: 28-30" work surface height for seated operation
3. **Transport**: Must fit in mid-size SUV and standard cargo vans
4. **Weight**: Target under 100 lbs total for single-person handling
5. **Budget**: $600-750 target (achievable with TNUTZ suppliers)

### Key Research Findings
- **Changed to 1010 Series** - Lighter, more cost-effective than 1515
- **TNUTZ offers excellent pricing** - $14.90 for 48" of 1010 ($0.31/inch)
- **Shadow Tool-inspired deployable panels** maximize organization
- **Hood-style lid design** (like US General carts) provides best access
- **Rock-N-Roller alternatives** exist but lack secure storage

- **Savings with TNUTZ**: ~35-40% ($270-300)
- **Weight**: ~73 lbs total (down from 95 lbs with 1515)

## Decisions Still Needed

### 1. COB Light Storage
- **Option A**: Custom drawer boxes in bottom compartment
- **Option B**: Foam cutouts with dividers
- **Option C**: Hanging brackets on interior panels
- **Consideration**: Lights are 11.4" × 8.7" × 3.5" each

### 2. Cable Organization Specifics
- How many hooks per panel? (Currently estimated 10 per side)
- Elastic loops vs velcro straps?
- Need cable identification system?
- Separate zones for different cable types?

### 3. Wing Slide Mechanism
- **Option A**: Heavy-duty drawer slides ($35 each, smooth operation)
- **Option B**: Aluminum C-channel guides (cheaper, simpler)
- **Option C**: 8020 linear bearing system (most expensive, smoothest)

### 4. Equipment Securing Method
- **Option A**: Industrial velcro strips
- **Option B**: Custom aluminum brackets
- **Option C**: Foam-lined recessed wells
- **Option D**: Combination of above

### 5. Additional Features Priority
**Rank these by importance:**
- Pull-out drawer for Rodecaster (for easier access)
- Locking mechanisms for security
- Push/pull handle on front or back
- Monitor cable management arm
- Built-in level indicators
- Accessory hooks on exterior
- Document/tablet holder
- Cup holder (seriously, for long events)

### 6. Surface Materials
- **Work Surface**: ABS, aluminum composite, or laminated MDF?
- **Cable Panels**: Perforated metal, solid ABS, or pegboard?
- **Hood**: Lightweight option to reduce top-heaviness?

### 7. Assembly Considerations
- Pre-cut extrusions from supplier or cut yourself?
- Anodized black (+15% cost) or clear aluminum?
- Professional assembly or DIY?
- Need assembly jig for square alignment?

- [ ] Acquire hardware and accessories

### Phase 3: Assembly
- [ ] Frame construction (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Panel fabrication and mounting (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Hardware installation (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Cable management setup (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Testing and adjustments (1-2 hours)
- **Total estimated assembly**: 10-16 hours

### Phase 4: Refinements

## Technical Notes for Next AI

### Working with the Configurator
- The current HTML artifact uses vanilla JavaScript with Three.js
- Can be converted to React if preferred
- All dimensions are parameterized for easy adjustment
- Parts calculation logic is modular and can be extracted

### Potential Improvements
1. Add SKU numbers for all parts
2. Create shopping cart export feature
3. Add CAD file generation
4. Include assembly instruction generator
5. Add photo-realistic rendering option

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Blender with CAD Sketcher**: More complex, less interactive
- **Traditional CAD**: Better for manufacturing, worse for iteration
- **Pre-built solutions**: Cheaper but less customizable

## Key Insights from Research

### Why Custom vs Commercial
- Commercial carts ($200-300) lack specific equipment integration
- No commercial option offers all three: mobility, security, and quick deployment
- Custom allows perfect fit for Tascam + Rodecaster combo
- Modular design enables future equipment changes

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Robust cable management** - Most important for efficiency
2. **Quick deployment** - Wings and panels must operate smoothly
3. **Transport durability** - Must survive repeated loading/unloading
4. **Professional appearance** - Important for client-facing events

### Lessons from Film Cart Community
- 4-6" wheels essential for rough terrain
- Carpet lining prevents equipment damage
- Quick-release mechanisms save significant setup time
- Integrated power distribution is non-negotiable

## Contact/Context
- **Use Case**: Panel conferences, live streaming events
- **Transport**: Personal vehicle, elevators, conference centers
- **Setup Time Target**: Under 10 minutes from arrival to operational
- **Breakdown Time Target**: Under 15 minutes to packed

## Next Steps for Continuing AI
1. Review all "Decisions Still Needed" section
2. Get user input on priorities
3. Update configurator with final choices
4. Generate final BOM with specific SKUs
5. Create assembly documentation
6. Consider creating purchase links/cart for supplies

## Current Code State
The interactive configurator is saved as an HTML artifact with:
- Full 3D visualization
- Parts list generator
- Cost calculator
- All math for materials calculation
- Responsive design
- Animation system for moving parts

The code can be copied and modified as needed. It's self-contained and runs in any modern browser.
