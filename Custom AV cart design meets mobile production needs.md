# Custom AV cart design meets mobile production needs

The optimal AV cart design combines modular 8020 aluminum construction with carefully considered dimensions of **30" W × 48" L × 62" H**, balancing professional functionality with critical transport constraints while achieving a target budget of $600-750 through strategic supplier selection. This research reveals that while commercial alternatives exist in the $200-300 range, a custom 8020-based solution offers superior adaptability, professional aesthetics, and long-term value for panel conference applications.

ADA elevator compliance drives the most restrictive design constraints, limiting cart width to 32 inches maximum with 4-inch clearance margins for safe navigation. The recommended dimensions accommodate the Tascam Model 12 mixer (13.5" × 14.2" × 3.9") and Rodecaster Video (12" × 5.2" × 2.4") while maintaining seated operation ergonomics at 28-30 inch work surface height. Total equipment weight of approximately 42 pounds requires 75-100 pound capacity casters with a 2x safety factor, resulting in a complete system weight under 100 pounds.

## Commercial alternatives reveal trade-offs between cost and functionality

The Harbor Freight analysis uncovered three distinct approaches to mobile AV storage. The **Husky Folding Utility Cart at $149** emerges as the portability champion, collapsing to just 16" × 9" × 33" for transport and potentially fitting within 27-gallon storage containers. This makes it ideal for frequent transport scenarios despite lacking secure storage. The **US General 30-inch service cart at $90-130** provides the best value with basic secure storage, though its single drawer limits organization potential. For maximum storage, the **US General 34×23 Full Bank cart at $500-600** offers 18,700 cubic inches of capacity but sacrifices portability with its 258-pound weight and 23-inch width that challenges elevator access.

Rock-N-Roller carts, specifically designed for AV professionals, offer eight configurations from a single $200 platform. These purpose-built solutions excel in versatility with all-terrain wheels and proven industry adoption, though they lack the secure storage and professional appearance of enclosed designs. The research indicates that while commercial options can serve basic needs, none fully address the specific requirements of consolidating Tascam and Rodecaster equipment with integrated monitor support and cable management.

## Design inspiration points toward modular, deployable systems

The Shadow Tool Staging Systems research revealed a revolutionary approach applicable to AV carts: **deployable wings that expand from 36 inches to 7.5 feet wide**, providing instant visual access to all equipment. This open-display concept reportedly saves technicians 30-90 minutes daily by eliminating drawer searching. For AV applications, this translates to side panels that could display cables, adapters, and frequently-accessed items during setup while maintaining a compact footprint for transport.

The 8020 aluminum van galley example demonstrated critical construction techniques including thermal isolation using closed-cell foam between aluminum and mounting surfaces, two panel attachment methods (inset versus overlay), and the importance of roll-in T-nuts for post-assembly modifications. These insights directly inform the AV cart's modular design philosophy, enabling configuration changes as equipment needs evolve without requiring complete rebuilds.

DIY film cart communities consistently emphasize three critical success factors: **robust cable management systems**, equipment-specific foam cutouts for protection, and the importance of 4-6 inch diameter wheels for rough terrain navigation. The most successful builds integrate power distribution with dedicated charging stations, use carpet-lined surfaces for equipment protection, and incorporate modular accessories via quick-release mechanisms.

## Blender integration requires manufacturing-focused add-ons

The research clarified an important distinction: Blender "MCP" primarily refers to Model Context Protocol for AI integration, not traditional machine control. For manufacturing workflows, **CAD Sketcher emerges as the essential add-on**, providing constraint-based 2D sketching with precision suitable for cut-list generation. This free tool integrates with Blender 4.2+ and enables parametric design through geometry nodes.

BlenderCAM (now FabexCNC) provides complete CNC toolpath generation with G-code export capabilities, supporting multiple milling strategies and over 10 post-processors. For bill of materials generation, Selection2BOM analyzes Blender assemblies to export detailed part lists with quantities. The recommended workflow involves using CAD Sketcher for precise 2D profiles, Geometry Nodes for parametric framework systems adjustable for different shelf heights, and MeasureIt for dimension documentation.

Critical limitations include limited STEP file export requiring FreeCAD as an intermediary and the absence of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. The practical solution involves using Blender for design visualization and preliminary modeling, then exporting DXF files for 2D cutting profiles and STL files for 3D printed components, while maintaining a structured project hierarchy with separate folders for reference images, component libraries, working files, and exports.

## Dimensional specifications balance multiple constraints

The comprehensive dimensional analysis revealed that **ADA elevator compliance represents the most restrictive constraint**, limiting cart width to 32 inches maximum through 36-inch minimum door clearances. Standard elevator cars measuring 68" × 54" × 80" accommodate the recommended 30" × 48" × 62" cart with adequate maneuvering space. This envelope also fits within standard 48" × 40" GMA pallets for shipping and typical 9-foot cargo van interiors.

Ergonomic requirements dictate specific height zones: the Rodecaster Video work surface at 28-30 inches for seated operation, the Tascam Model 12 at the same level or slightly above for comfortable fader access, and the 15-inch monitor on a pneumatic arm positioned 20-24 inches from the operator at 45-50 inches floor height. Cable access zones extend 18 inches from the seated position for primary access, with secondary zones to 24 inches.

The 27-gallon storage box constraint, with internal dimensions of 24.75" × 15.75" × 14.375", proves incompatible with assembled cart dimensions but could accommodate individual components or a highly collapsible design. Vehicle transport in mid-size SUVs limits cart height to approximately 35 inches, suggesting a modular approach with removable upper sections for maximum transport flexibility.

## 8020 aluminum construction offers optimal balance of features

The 8020 research revealed significant cost savings through alternative suppliers, with **TNUTZ offering 70% lower hardware prices** compared to 8020 Inc. direct purchasing. For the recommended cart size, 15-series profiles provide adequate strength with 1515 profiles supporting 265 pounds uniformly distributed load at just 1.17 pounds per foot. The ultra-lite variants reduce weight by 21% while maintaining 70% of standard capacity, ideal for mobile applications.

Critical hardware specifications include 4-inch swivel casters with brakes rated for 200-300 pounds each at $45-55 per unit, corner brackets ranging from basic 2-hole designs at $2.50 to heavy-duty 6-hole wide brackets at $15-20, and roll-in T-nuts at $1.00-1.25 each enabling post-assembly modifications. Cable management accessories through third-party suppliers cost 75% less than OEM options while maintaining compatibility.

The complete frame cost estimate for a 30" × 24" × 40" cart totals **$600-750 using alternative suppliers versus $950-1,200 from 8020 Inc. direct**. This includes approximately 480 inches of extrusion at $418-538, essential hardware at $120-200, four heavy-duty casters at $180, and cable management systems at $40-60. Assembly requires 8-12 hours using basic tools including T-handle hex keys and a torque wrench for proper 10-15 ft-lb fastener tension.

## Consolidated requirements define scalable solution

The research synthesis yields a comprehensive requirements specification for the custom AV cart. **Primary dimensions of 30" W × 48" L × 62" H** accommodate all equipment while meeting transport constraints. The top shelf features the Tascam Model 12 with a fold-up lid containing the 15-inch monitor on pneumatic support, requiring 4-inch clearance for the support column and 12-18 inches vertical travel. The second shelf positions the Rodecaster Video at 28-30 inches for seated operation with 6-inch operational clearance on all sides.

Structural requirements specify 8020 15-series aluminum extrusion for the main frame with 1515-UL profiles for weight optimization and 1530 profiles for horizontal rails requiring higher load capacity. Four-inch locking swivel casters rated for 200 pounds each provide mobility across various terrains while maintaining stability during operation. The modular design philosophy enables post-assembly reconfiguration through roll-in T-nuts and standardized mounting points.

Storage specifications include 1-2 vertical shelves utilizing Shadow Tool-inspired deployable panels for cable and adapter organization, 1-2 horizontal shelves for accessories with 12" × 16" × 12" dedicated cable storage, and bottom compartment COB light storage requiring approximately 6" × 6" × 20" volume. XLR and quarter-inch cable routing follows the rear frame members with exit points at operation height, while integrated power distribution includes master shutoff and dedicated device charging stations.

## Implementation pathway leverages modular approach

The recommended implementation strategy begins with **Blender model development using CAD Sketcher for precision 2D profiles** and Geometry Nodes for parametric adjustability. Generate cut-lists through Selection2BOM, export DXF files for aluminum cutting services, and create assembly documentation using MeasureIt. This digital-first approach enables iteration before material commitment.

Procurement should prioritize TNUTZ for extrusions and standard hardware, achieving 70% savings on brackets and fasteners while maintaining quality. Order 15-series profiles in clear anodized finish for cost optimization or black anodized for premium appearance. Source generic hardware from McMaster-Carr for immediate availability and standardized components. Budget $50-75 for assembly tools if not already available.

The assembly sequence follows a logical progression: construct the base frame with casters first, add vertical posts ensuring square alignment, install horizontal rails and shelf supports, integrate cable management systems, mount equipment brackets and hardware, and complete with the pneumatic monitor support mechanism. Apply thread locker to all critical connections and maintain 10-15 ft-lb torque specifications for drop-lock engagement.

## Conclusion

This research establishes that while commercial carts in the $200-300 range offer basic functionality, a custom 8020 aluminum solution at $600-750 provides superior value through modularity, professional appearance, and precise equipment integration. The combination of Shadow Tool-inspired deployable storage, 8020's infinite adjustability, and Blender-based parametric design creates a scalable platform adaptable to evolving AV requirements. Implementation through alternative suppliers like TNUTZ reduces costs by 30-40% while maintaining professional quality, making custom construction financially competitive with high-end commercial alternatives. The final design successfully consolidates all specified AV resources into a mobile unit meeting stringent transport constraints while maintaining operational efficiency for panel conference applications.
